## Command-Line Status Check

To see which vendors currently support firmware and backup operations in your build, run:

```bash
nw firmware vendors
nw backup vendors
```

Note: Each vendor page follows the same structure so itâ€™s easy to read and easy for tools/LLMs to parse: overview, identifiers, supported operations, firmware management, backups, built-in sequences, examples, and configuration tips. When adding a new vendor, mirror this structure for consistency.
