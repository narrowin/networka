# To add
- add option to all commands running a remote ssh session to ignore the server ssh key mismatch error and ccontinue
- make output less verbose by not defaulting to INFO output
    is this actually read from ~/.config/networka/config.yaml?
- howto is the config backup path derived?

# To try out
- run networka in gemini-cli interactive shell and see what we can do running in a containerlab
