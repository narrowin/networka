## _The Networka Monologue_

_“People ask the question…_ <br>
**what’s a Networka?** <br>

And I tell 'em — <br>
it's **not** about cables, configs, and pings. <br>
_Oh no._ <br>
There’s more to it than that, my friend. <br>

We all like a bit of the good life — <br>
some the uptime, some the security, <br>
others the automation, the visibility, or the compliance. <br>

But a **Networka**, oh, they're different. <br>
Why? <br>
Because a real **Networka** wants the f\*ing lot.”<br><br>
(inspired by: [RockNRolla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4YLBqMJYOo))

## Installation

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Python**: 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13
- **Network Access**: SSH connectivity to target devices
- **Package Manager**: uv (recommended) or pip

### Quick Install

```bash
# Easiest (user-wide, isolated)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/narrowin/networka.git
# or
pipx install git+https://github.com/narrowin/networka.git

# If you prefer plain pip (user-wide, no sudo)
pip install --user git+https://github.com/narrowin/networka.git
# ensure ~/.local/bin (or platform-specific bin) is on PATH

# Verify installation works
nw --help
```

### Upgrade & Remove

```bash
# Upgrade to latest version
uv tool upgrade networka
# or
pipx upgrade networka
# or
pip install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/narrowin/networka.git

# Remove installation
uv tool uninstall networka
# or
pipx uninstall networka
# or
pip uninstall networka
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Linux/macOS**: No additional dependencies required

**Windows**: Scrapli (the default transport) does not officially support native Windows. While it may work with Paramiko or ssh2-python drivers, the recommended approach is to run Networka on WSL2 (Ubuntu) for a fully supported POSIX environment. Native Windows usage is best-effort.

## Quick Start

Get up and running with config-init command:

```bash
# 1. Initialize your configuration environment
nw config-init
# This creates: .env, config/config.yml, config/devices/, config/groups/, config/sequences/

# 2. Update credentials and device IPs
nano .env                           # Add your actual credentials
nano config/devices/mikrotik.yml    # Update device IP addresses

# 3. Start managing your network
nw run sw-office-01 system_info
nw run office_switches "/system/identity/print"
```

## Terminology: device_type vs hardware platform vs transport

- device_type: Network OS driver used for connections and commands (Scrapli "platform"). Examples: mikrotik_routeros, cisco_iosxe, arista_eos, juniper_junos. Set per device and used to resolve vendor-aware sequences.
- platform (hardware/firmware): Hardware architecture used for firmware-related operations. Examples: x86, x86_64, arm, mipsbe, tile. Not used for SSH connections or command execution.
- transport: Connection backend used by Networka. Default is scrapli; nornir-netmiko transport is planned (not yet supported).

Note about flags: When targeting IP addresses directly, the CLI flag --platform refers to the network driver (device_type), not the hardware architecture.

## Connection transports

- Default: Scrapli (stable)
- CLI override: use --transport to select the connection backend per run
- Planned: nornir-netmiko integration. Note: nornir-netmiko is not yet supported but coming soon.

## networka environment

### 1. Set up credentials for network device logins

**Option A: Use .env file (Recommended)**

```bash
# Copy and edit the example file
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your actual credentials
```

**Option B: Export environment variables**

```bash
# Set environment variables for security
export NW_USER_DEFAULT="admin"
export NW_PASSWORD_DEFAULT="your_secure_password"  # pragma: allowlist secret

# Device-specific overrides (optional)
export NW_PASSWORD_SW_ACC1="switch1_password"  # pragma: allowlist secret
```

### 2. Create configuration files

Create `config/config.yml` for general settings:

```yaml
general:
  results_dir: "./results"
  timeout: 30
```

Create `config/devices/devices.yml` for your devices:

```yaml
devices:
  sw-acc1:
    host: "10.10.1.11"
    device_type: "mikrotik_routeros"
    description: "Access Switch 1"
    tags: ["access", "critical"]

  cisco-sw1:
    host: "10.10.1.20"
    device_type: "cisco_iosxe"
    description: "Cisco Switch"
    tags: ["core", "cisco"]
```

Create `config/groups/groups.yml` for device groups:

```yaml
groups:
  all_switches:
    description: "All network switches"
    members: ["sw-acc1", "cisco-sw1"]
```

### 3. Run your first commands

```bash
# Test connectivity
nw run sw-acc1 "/system/identity/print"

# Execute on device group
nw run all_switches "show version"

# Store results automatically
nw run sw-acc1 health_check --store-results
```

## Configuration

Networka uses a flexible configuration system supporting both YAML and CSV formats, with hierarchical loading from directories and subdirectories.

### Enhanced Configuration Features

- **Multiple formats**: YAML and CSV files supported
- **Subdirectory organization**: Split configurations across directories
- **Hierarchical loading**: More specific configs override general ones
- **Mixed format support**: Use both YAML and CSV in the same project

### Environment variables

**Automatic .env Loading** - The toolkit automatically loads credentials from `.env` files:

```bash
# Copy the example and edit with your credentials
cp .env.example .env

# Credentials are loaded automatically when you run commands
nw run system_info sw-acc1
```

**Manual Environment Variables** - You can also set them manually:

```bash
# Default credentials (required)
export NW_USER_DEFAULT="admin"
export NW_PASSWORD_DEFAULT="your_secure_password"  # pragma: allowlist secret

# Device-specific overrides (optional)
export NW_PASSWORD_SW_ACC1="switch1_password"  # pragma: allowlist secret
```

### Configuration Structure

#### Modular Directory Structure

#### CSV Format Reference

**Devices CSV Headers:**

```csv
name,host,device_type,description,platform,model,location,tags
sw-01,192.168.1.1,mikrotik_routeros,Lab Switch,mipsbe,CRS326,Lab,switch;access;lab
```

Notes:

- device_type = network driver (Scrapli platform); controls connection behavior and command semantics
- platform = hardware architecture for firmware tasks (upgrade/downgrade/bootloader)

**Groups CSV Headers:**

```csv
name,description,members,match_tags
lab_devices,Lab environment,sw-01;sw-02,lab;test
```

**Sequences CSV Headers:**

```csv
name,description,commands,tags
system_info,Get system info,/system/identity/print;/system/clock/print,system;info
```

### Configuration file structure

**Main Configuration (`config/config.yml`):**

```yaml
general:
  results_dir: "./results"
  timeout: 30
  output_mode: "dark" # default, light, dark, no-color, raw
```

**Device Configuration (`config/devices/*.yml`):**

```yaml
devices:
  device_name:
    host: "IP_ADDRESS"
  device_type: "mikrotik_routeros" # network driver (Scrapli platform): cisco_iosxe, arista_eos, juniper_junos, ...
  # platform: "mipsbe"            # hardware architecture for firmware ops (optional)
    description: "Device description"
    tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
```

**Group Configuration (`config/groups/*.yml`):**

```yaml
groups:
  group_name:
    description: "Group description"
    match_tags: ["tag1"] # Include devices with these tags
    # OR
    members: ["device1", "device2"] # Explicit device list
```

**Sequence Configuration (`config/sequences/*.yml`):**

```yaml
sequences:
  sequence_name:
    description: "Sequence description"
    commands:
      - "/system/identity/print"
      - "/system/clock/print"
    tags: ["system", "info"]
```

### Loading Priority

Configuration files are loaded from their respective subdirectories. All files in each subdirectory are combined (later files override earlier ones):

1. **Device files**: All files in `config/devices/` (_.yml, _.yaml, \*.csv)
2. **Group files**: All files in `config/groups/` (_.yml, _.yaml, \*.csv)
3. **Sequence files**: All files in `config/sequences/` (_.yml, _.yaml, \*.csv)

Within each directory, files are loaded alphabetically, so later files can override earlier ones.

### Getting Started

1. **Copy examples**: Start with the templates in `config/examples/`
2. **Create your configs**: Place your configurations in the appropriate subdirectories:
   - `config/devices/` for device definitions
   - `config/groups/` for group definitions
   - `config/sequences/` for sequence definitions
3. **Mix formats**: Use YAML for complex configs and CSV for bulk data
4. **Organize by purpose**: Create multiple files organized by site, customer, or environment

See `config/examples/` for detailed examples and migration guides.

### Output modes

Control colors and formatting with the `output_mode` setting:

```yaml
general:
  output_mode: "dark" # default, light, dark, no-color, raw
```

**Modes:**

- `default` - Rich's built-in styling (adapts to terminal)
- `light` - Dark colors optimized for light terminal themes
- `dark` - Bright colors optimized for dark terminal themes
- `no-color` - Structured output without colors (accessibility)
- `raw` - Machine-readable format for scripts/automation

**Override precedence:**

1. CLI flag: `nw info device1 --output-mode raw`
2. Environment: `export NW_OUTPUT_MODE=light`
3. Config file: `general.output_mode`

## Examples

### Single device operations

```bash
# Execute a command on a device
nw run sw-acc1 "/system/resource/print"

# Run a predefined sequence
nw run sw-acc1 health_check

# Upload firmware file
nw upload sw-acc1 firmware.npk

# Download configuration backup
nw download sw-acc1 config.backup
```

### Multi-vendor automation

```bash
# Automatically uses correct vendor commands
nw run mikrotik-sw1 system_info    # Uses RouterOS commands
nw run cisco-sw1 system_info       # Uses IOS-XE commands
nw run arista-sw1 system_info      # Uses EOS commands

# Run on mixed-vendor groups
nw run all_switches health_check   # Each device gets vendor-specific commands
```

### Group operations

```bash
# Execute command on device group
nw run access_switches "/interface/print stats"

# Run sequence on entire group with results storage
nw run critical_devices security_audit --store-results
```

### Results management

```bash
# Store results with timestamps
nw run sw-acc1 health_check --store-results

# Custom results directory
nw run sw-acc1 diagnostic --results-dir ./maintenance-2025-08

# Different output formats
nw run sw-acc1 system_info --store-results --results-format json
```

### Vendor-specific backup operations

Networka provides vendor-specific backup operations that automatically use the correct commands and file formats for each platform:

```bash
# Configuration backup (text-only configuration export)
nw config-backup sw-acc1                    # MikroTik: /export commands
nw config-backup cisco-sw1                  # Cisco: show running-config
nw config-backup --no-download sw-acc1      # Create but don't download files

# Comprehensive backup (configuration + system data)
nw backup sw-acc1                           # MikroTik: /export + /system/backup
nw backup cisco-sw1                         # Cisco: show commands (running/startup/version/inventory)
nw backup office_switches                   # Run on device group

# Options for backup operations
nw config-backup sw-acc1 --delete-remote    # Remove remote files after download
nw backup sw-acc1 --verbose                 # Detailed operation logging
```

**Platform-specific behavior:**

- **MikroTik RouterOS**: Creates .rsc (export) and .backup (system) files
- **Cisco IOS/IOS-XE**: Displays configuration and system information (typically not saved to files)
- **Download handling**: Automatically determines which files to download based on platform
