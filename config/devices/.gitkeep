# This file ensures the config/sequences/ directory is tracked in git
# while ignoring the actual configuration files for security.
#
# Place your sequence configurations here:
# - sequences.yml (main sequence definitions)
# - *.yml (additional sequence files)
# - *.csv (CSV format sequence lists)
#
# Vendor-specific sequences in subdirectories are preserved.
# See config/examples/ for templates and examples.
