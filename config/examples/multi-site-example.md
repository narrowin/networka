## Usage Examples

### Site-Specific Operations

```bash
# Check health of all headquarters equipment
nw run headquarters_all health_check

# Monitor all branch office devices
nw run branch_office_all interface_monitoring

# Backup all critical devices
nw run critical_infrastructure backup_config
```

### Device Type Operations

```bash
# Security audit on all firewalls
nw run all_firewalls security_audit

# Monitor all wireless access points
nw run wireless_infrastructure wireless_monitoring

# Check routing on edge devices
nw run edge_devices routing_analysis
```

### Maintenance Operations

```bash
# Weekend maintenance on access switches
nw run maintenance_weekend clear_logs

# Update time on all devices
nw run backup_priority_high update_time

# Health check on lab equipment before testing
nw run lab_environment health_check
```

### Individual Device Operations

```bash
# Check specific device
nw info sw-hq-floor1

# Check device group details
nw info hq_infrastructure

# Check sequence information
nw info health_check

# Run command on specific device
nw run fw-main "/ip/firewall/connection/print count-only"

# Upload firmware to lab device
nw upload sw-lab-01 firmware/routeros-7.x.npk
```

## Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Scalability**: Easy to add new sites by creating new CSV files
2. **Flexibility**: Mix YAML for complex configs and CSV for bulk data
3. **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns by site and device type
4. **Maintainability**: Updates to device lists don't require YAML editing
5. **Integration**: CSV files can be generated from asset management systems
6. **Consistency**: Standardized tagging enables powerful group operations

## Migration Strategy

1. **Start with core devices** in YAML format for complex configurations
2. **Add site-specific devices** using CSV for bulk additions
3. **Create logical groups** based on operational needs
4. **Define common sequences** for routine operations
5. **Gradually migrate** from manual processes to automated sequences

This example shows how the enhanced configuration system scales from small networks to enterprise deployments while maintaining clarity and ease of management.
